## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the tutorial **"【3小時JavaScript課程】從零基礎到開發第一個應用"** by **走歪的工程師James**. The majority of the code and concepts used here (approximately 80-90%) are based on James' tutorial. You can find [the original tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDNw0FWL8zw) on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@james-kool).

Additionally, this project marks my **first experience learning web development**. Through this journey, I gained hands-on experience with creating sound user interfaces with CSS and HTML, managing user interactions with JavaScript, and implementing persistent data storage using localStorage. It was a rewarding process that solidified my interest in building practical applications.
